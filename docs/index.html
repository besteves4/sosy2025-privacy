            <p>
                The Privacy & Personal Data Management Session of the Solid Symposium 2025 aims to bring together 
                technical and legal-ethical experts to discuss Solid as a concrete system for data governance,
                to ground the debate on emergent problems from both a technical perspective and a 
                legal-ethical perspective of data protection.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In this edition, we aim to continue the discussions around technical and legal privacy aspects that 
                should be incorporated into Solid. We aim to draw from a broad interdisciplinary perspective on privacy
                and personal data management, including human-centric perspectives on privacy and the emergence of 
                personal data spaces and digital wallets. Towards this aim, the programme will be a mix of flash talks 
                from extended abstracts and presentations of short papers to showcase the 
                current state of research and trajectories in privacy-related research in Solid.

                The Privacy & Personal Data Management Session aims to bring together technical and legal-ethical experts to discuss 
                Solid as a concrete system for data governance, to ground the debate on emergent problems from both a technical 
                perspective and a legal-ethical perspective of data protection. The first two editions of this Session were co-located 
                with the Solid Symposium 2023 and 2024 and were hosted in Nürnberg, Germany, and 
                <a href=https://solidweb.me/besteves4/sosy24-privacy/privacy-session.html target="_blank">Leuven, Belgium</a>, respectively.
                The previous editions explored privacy-related problems concerning identity management, security, and authorization 
                in Solid from an interdisciplinary perspective. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In this edition, we aim to discuss technical and legal privacy aspects that should be incorporated into Solid. 
                We aim to draw from a broad interdisciplinary perspective on privacy and personal data management, including 
                human-centric perspectives and the emergence of personal data spaces and digital wallets.
                The session welcomes a broad range of methodologies not limited to semantics and knowledge engineering, 
                proof-of-concept implementations, and methodologies drawn from legal and social sciences.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Thus, this session comprises presentations from short papers and flash talks from extended abstracts in related areas 
                not limited to the following:
